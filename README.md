# PSAS Flight Data

![Launch 10 Mission Patch](http://psas.pdx.edu/launch10/LV2.3-October.png)

On June 30th 2013 [PSAS](http://psas.pdx.edu) launched an amateur class
high powered rocket in the empty Central Oregon desert. This repo contains
the raw data and tools used to analize the data from the many computers
onboard the rocket.

## Raw Data

The raw data is in folders named after the device the date comes from.

 - `sim/`: OpenRocket and other simulation files.
 - `fc/`: Flight Computer logs
 - `arts/`: Data from ARTS board


Note on "raw" data. Some of the data will be preprocessed either by
the tools that come with the device (in the case of the commercial
flight computers) or on the chips themselves. Whenever possible the
most raw data available will be posted.
