## Raw Data

The raw data is in folders named after the device the date comes from.

 - `./sim/`: OpenRocket and other Simulation files.


Note on "raw" data. Some of the data will be preprocessed either by
the tools that come with the device (in the case of the commercial
flight computers) or on the chips themselves. Whenever possible the
most raw data available will be posted.
